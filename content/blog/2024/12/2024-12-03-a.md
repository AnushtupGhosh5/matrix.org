The Matrix.org Foundation has been made aware that an international investigative operation [took down a cybercriminal network called MATRIX](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/international-operation-takes-down-another-encrypted-messaging-service-used-criminals). The service *might* have been built using the Matrix protocol, but we’re unaware of it if so.

The [takedown site](https://www.operation-passionflower.com/) has a Matrix-the-movie branding, which is a probable source of confusion. The app showcased doesn’t look like any of the Matrix clients we’re aware of.
